<p >Professional Bachelor Multimedia and Communication Technology</a>, specialized in Audiovisual productions. However, I quickly refactored myself to web-development due to a much better work-life relationship at the time.</p>

<div class=\\"column-lg-2 column-xxl-3 mb-ggy\\" >
<p >This project began at the end of 2017. The Evenementenkluis (roughly translated the \\"Event Vault\\") is a web platform where organizers can manage the entire municipal regulation around an event from start to end in a single place and where local authorities can follow and assist it at any given time.</p>
<p >With the help of a few simple multiple choice questions, organizers can get the necessary form, fill it in online and submit it. The competent authorities can provide their own specialized advice per form. Depending on these recommendations, an organizer can make the necessary changes in time before the start of the event.</p>
<p >As of 2019, Pixeo is full build-mode for the Evenementenkluis's next feature, a full blown rental module. This enables organizers to immediately rent out the necessary materials for her/his event. From the organizer's point of view, everything is nicely bundled and organized within one event view en several subviews. Behind the scenes, the rental request is send to the right person within the municipality, like the rental-manager, logistic personnel.</p>
<p >Cypress</a>.</p>
<p >Since September 2018 we have been in production with v1.0.0 of the Event Safe in 2 municipalities. The goal of the Evenementenkluis is provide every municipality in Flanders with this platform.</p>
<p >Shortly after the release of v1.0.0, my function within the project was briefly changed to following up on incoming feedback, bugs and feature requests. A.h.v. screenshots or video replays of the relevant feedback, I pass this on as clearly as possible to my fellow developers via the GitLab issue boards. I consult with the team on how we can implement new features in the most usable and efficient way.</p>

<p >Royce</a>. A fresh and exciting combination of local metal alumni which are slowly but steadily unleashing their wrath of fast melodic metalcore upon you.</p>
</div>
<div class=\\"column-lg-2 column-xxl-3 mb-ggy\\" >
<p >After Angelskin had called out an indefinite hiatus in 2012, guitarist Foxy &amp; bass player Matty set out for new musical chapter in their lives. After a mindful search, they teamed up with longtime friends Ben from Strike With Vengeance on drums, Tom of Darker Days Ahead on guitar and Tim on vocals. In the summer of 2013 they started out the new Belgian metal formation which they have named Royce.</p>
<p >After a well thought out one-year writing phase, they released their first self-recorded demo song „Words”. Main influences range from melodic punk like AFI and Alexisonfire via pounding metalcore, Parkway Drive &amp; Trivium to the more extreme forms of the metal genre like Gojira and Behemoth. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Their music tends to be an original take on the modern metalcore genre that exists today.</p>
<p >Combined with several other creative and professional abilities on which they apply a hardcore DIY working ethic they will get you to notice them, in one way or another. Royce is about doing the things you like with you’re friends and doing it with most the passion and conviction as possible.</p>
<p >Open your eyes, the change is right in front of you.</p>
