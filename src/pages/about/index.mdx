## Personal

I have a profound love for [loud and emotive music](https://open.spotify.com/user/116335225/playlist/1VXRoUysOyzh5Y0m82jjVI). In 2017, I listened to approximately 51.000 minutes of music. To blow off some steam, me and my buddies in [ROYCE](http://roycetheband.com) rock out the local and non-local watering holes from time to time.

I have a [Professional Bachelor Multimedia and Communication Technology](https://www.kdg.be/multimedia-creative-technologies), specialized in Audiovisual productions. However, I quickly refactored myself to web-development due to a much better work-life relationship at the time.

All the knowledge I currently possess is self-taught through 10+ years of experience in the working field and a great amount curiosity.
