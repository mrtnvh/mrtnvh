The [Coven of Wisdom](https://covenofwisdom.io/) is a meetup community for sharing and learning all things technology in the Netherlands.

Born from the ashes of the Eindhoven Front-end and iO Campus Eindhoven meetup group, we want to broaden our horizons. Digital projects aren't merely front-end. They're a collaborative effort between all types of technologies and experts.

With the Coven of Wisdom, we want to encourage digital talents to take a look over the proverbial fence and share insights on other parts of the tech stack. All this in a very accessible, informal way, every first Thursday of each season
