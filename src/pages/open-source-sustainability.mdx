Our current digitalized society is built upon thousands of pieces of Open Source software. What starts out as a fun hobby project has more than often led to an industry standard. How can the companies of today sustain their Open Source supply chain, make sure that resources are divided equitably? I'd like to give you some insights into research on how the current Open Source funding landscape looks like, what problems we face and what possible solutions could pave the way forward.

The first steps in this journey is co-authoring the ISAAC Open Source Manifesto and actively promoting a culture of giving back to the open-source community. By holding an Open Source Contribution Day twice a year, we celebrate and encourage this culture of sharing and collaboration.
