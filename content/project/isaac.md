Starting in May 2019, I've joined the front-end team at ISAAC to built awesome web-experiences. I focus mostly on implementing [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) & [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) in enterprise level web applications. ISAAC has ~~weilded Mjolnir~~ proven their skills by being crowned **#1 Fullservice Digital Agency** 2 consecutive years in a row in 2018 and 2019.

As a profound advocate for qualitative **U**ser e**X**periences, I quickly joined the ISAAC Testing Guild, cross-company group featuring members from all specialisations which ISAAC has to offer, where best practices around testing software are researched, documented and  offered to the entire ISAAC team.

I am currently taking a deep dive in said OpenAPI specification and set a personal goal of becoming the de facto person to talk if you have any OpenAPI questions.
