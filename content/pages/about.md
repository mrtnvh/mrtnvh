## Hi there,

I'm Maarten Van Hoof, a 30-year front-end developer, but mostly an enthusiast of all things web, living in Turnhout, Belgium.

I'm a proud father of Adriaan & Floris, 2 unbelievably smart boys. I'm incredibly humbled to share my life with Sabine, my bestie, and partner-in-crime.

I have a profound love for [loud and emotive music](https://open.spotify.com/user/116335225/playlist/1VXRoUysOyzh5Y0m82jjVI). In 2017, I listened to approximately 51.000 minutes of music. To blow off some steam, me and my buddies in [Royce](http://roycetheband.com) rock out the local and non-local watering holes from time to time.

I have a [Professional Bachelor Multimedia and Communication Technology](https://www.kdg.be/en/education/study-programmes-dutch/multimedia-and-communication-technology/multimedia-technology), specialized in Audiovisual productions. However, I quickly refactored myself to web-development due to a much better work-life relationship at the time.

All the knowledge I currently possess is self-taught through experience, tutorials and occasional Google, StackOverflow and not-so-occasional Open Source Software.


## Ambition
I want to be part of a team with clear vision and resources to build an awesome product. Something that is used on a day-to-day basis. Something where documentation and automation take away stress and frustration. Where great innovations are quickly evaluated and implemented if proven significant. Where motivation flourishes. Where we can build a positive future by giving back to our community.
